# 🤖 ChatGPT - Introduction

---

## 📌 Description

This project introduces practical ways to use **ChatGPT** to improve everyday coding work, with a focus on:

- **Debugging**: identify bugs faster, understand why they happen, and fix them cleanly.
- **Automation**: generate repetitive code (boilerplate), documentation, and basic helpers to save time and reduce mistakes.

The goal is not to blindly trust AI — but to use it as a tool, while still **testing, verifying, and validating** everything.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

### 🐛 Debugging
- Use ChatGPT to diagnose errors in provided code samples.
- Fix bugs across different languages/environments.
- Learn common pitfalls (logic errors, infinite loops, wrong selectors/IDs, input handling, etc.).
- Improve your ability to explain what was wrong and why the fix works.

### ⚙️ Automation
- Use ChatGPT to automate boring or repetitive tasks:
  - documentation
  - boilerplate
  - simple helper functions
  - basic test scaffolding (when relevant)

---

## ✅ Expected Outcomes

- **Enhanced Debugging Skills**
  - More confidence troubleshooting code
  - Better reasoning about failures
  - Ability to clearly describe what was wrong and why the fix works

- **Automation Proficiency**
  - Faster creation of structured code
  - Cleaner outputs (documentation + helpers)
  - Reduced time spent on repetitive tasks

---

## 🧪 Important Note

ChatGPT can be wrong.

You must:
- **test your code**
- **verify outputs**
- **double-check assumptions**
- **question the suggested fixes when needed**

AI is an assistant, not an oracle.

## ▶️ Usage

Run Python scripts:

```bash
./file.py
# or
python3 file.py
```

Example:

```bash
./factorial.py 5
```

Run HTML (open in browser):

- Open `change_background.html` in your browser
- Click the button to test behavior

---

## 🧩 Tasks Summary

- **T0**: Fix factorial loop (infinite loop)
- **T1**: Print only arguments (exclude script name)
- **T2**: Fix HTML/JS click handler (ID mismatch, behavior)
- **T3**: Add win condition to Minesweeper
- **T4**: Fix + document recursive factorial
- **T5**: Add input error-handling to Checkbook
- **T6**: Fix Tic Tac Toe input handling and game logic (validate inputs, handle draw)

---

## 🧾 Requirements

- Python 3
- Basic terminal usage
- Ability to run scripts and test cases
- A browser for HTML/JS testing
